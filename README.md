# Weather App

[Link to project](https://s92xiong.github.io/weather-app/).

The goal of this project was to build a weather application that can retrieve global weather data. An emphasis on this project is to learn the fundamentals of asynchronous javascript: understanding how promises work, how to handle them and how to retrieve data of interest and apply it to a produce a desired UI. Difficulties that I experienced during this project include learning how to perform multiple async API calls, and knowing how to manage conditional statements in React to ensure that certain API-dependent UI does not cause the app to crash.

Another issue I faced was that the API did not return the current time of the location. In this project, I wanted to display the current time of a location which required me to learn how to properly manage date objects and methods, e.g. new Date() and setDate(), and using a timezone offset to extract the time via getUTCDate, etc. Overall, this was a great learning experience for dealing with asynchronous javascript code.
